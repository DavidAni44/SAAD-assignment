and the page layouts

## Considered Options

* JavaScript
* React

### Consequences

* Good, because it will allow development to go more smoothly as developers don't need to spend time learning new technologies
* Good, because HTML/CSS is widely used and will have a variety of features available to create the AML
* Bad, because simplicity may lead to certain desired features being unavailable
